{-
If 'side-band' or 'side-band-64k' capabilities have been specified by
the client, the server will send the packfile data multiplexed.

Each packet starting with the packet-line length of the amount of data
that follows, followed by a single byte specifying the sideband the
following data is coming in on.

In 'side-band' mode, it will send up to 999 data bytes plus 1 control
code, for a total of up to 1000 bytes in a pkt-line.  In 'side-band-64k'
mode it will send up to 65519 data bytes plus 1 control code, for a
total of up to 65520 bytes in a pkt-line.

The sideband byte will be a '1', '2' or a '3'. Sideband '1' will contain
packfile data, sideband '2' will be used for progress information that the
client will generally print to stderr and sideband '3' is used for error
information.

If no 'side-band' capability was specified, the server will stream the
entire packfile without multiplexing.
